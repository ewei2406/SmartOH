![login](images/login.png)
Login Splash. A tab is used to select if you are a TA or a student!
### Functionality for Students
![join](images/class_student.png)
The student landing page shows live previews of the status of each Office Hour room, along with AI-powered predictions for wait times.

![join_filter](images/join_filters.png)
Students can also easily filter their office hours by class!

![question](images/question.png)
To join the Queue, a student must enter their question.

![queue](images/queue_student.png)
A student can view relevant data while waiting in the queue, such as their position, wait time, and who the TAs and other students are.


![AIhelp](images/ai_help_1.png)
If a TA isn't available, ask the AI TA for help!

The AI TA isn't a full substitute for a real TA, but it can definitely make a TA's life easier by explaining basic concepts.

### Functionality for TAs
![class](images/class_ta.png)
The TA landing page is similar, except that TAs do not join the Queue nor need to ask questions.
