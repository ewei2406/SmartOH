Login Splash. A tab is used to select if you are a TA or a student!
### Functionality for Students
![join](images/class_student.png)
The student landing page shows live previews of the status of each Office Hour room, along with AI-powered predictions for wait times.

Students can also easily filter their office hours by class!

To join the Queue, a student must enter their question.

A student can view relevant data while waiting in the queue, such as their position, wait time, and who the TAs and other students are.

If a TA isn't available, ask the AI TA for help!

The AI TA isn't a full substitute for a real TA, but it can definitely make a TA's life easier by explaining basic concepts.

### Functionality for TAs
